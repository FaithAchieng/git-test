# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

The challenges I faced while creating this project is using the card and adjusting the width of the QR code to be able to match with the given picture.
But overall the project was simple and I enjoyed coding it.
